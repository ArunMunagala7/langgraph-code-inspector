## 🎬 WHAT TO DEMO IN PRESENTATION

### Current Features (1 minute)
- Upload code → Get analysis
- Flowchart visualization
- Call graph
- Quality metrics

### NEW Feature Demo (3-4 minutes) ⭐
**Option 1: Code Comparison**
```
Show: "Here's poorly optimized bubble sort"
→ Analyze
→ Show bugs and quality issues
→ Then show optimized version
→ Compare side-by-side
→ AI says "Quality improved by 40%, 2 bugs fixed"
BOOM! 💥 Audience impressed
```

**Option 2: Learning Modes**
```
Show: Same code in three modes
→ Beginner explanation (simple, analogies)
→ Interview explanation (technical, complexity focus)
→ Optimization explanation (performance-focused)
BOOM! 💥 Shows AI versatility
```

## 💡 INSIDER TIPS FOR PRESENTATION

1. **Lead with a Problem**
   - "Developers spend hours understanding legacy code"
   - "Code reviews miss edge cases"
   - "Learning to code is overwhelming"

2. **Show Current Solution Working**
   - Pick a good algorithm (Binary Search, Fibonacci)
   - Show flowchart, explanation, analysis
   - Should take 10-15 seconds

3. **Introduce NEW Feature**
   - "But what if you could compare code quality?"
   - Or "What if it could teach beginners AND interview candidates?"
   - Demo the feature (2-3 minutes)

4. **Emphasize Value**
   - Time saved: "Instead of manual code review, 10 seconds"
   - Quality: "Never miss edge cases again"
   - Learning: "Learn from AI analysis"

5. **Close with Roadmap**
   - Show 2-3 future features
   - Makes project feel alive and growing

## 🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION

**For tomorrow's presentation:**

Start with **CODE COMPARISON** (2.5 hours):
- It's the most impressive feature visually
- Easy to understand for any audience
- Perfect demo story: "Bad code → Good code → See the difference"
- Can be demoed in 2 minutes
- Shows deep AI understanding

Then **LEARNING MODES** if time allows (2 hours):
- Shows system is not one-size-fits-all
- Appeals to students, professionals, interviewers
- Can be demoed in 1 minute

These two together create a **knockout presentation** 🚀
